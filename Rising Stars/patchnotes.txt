v1.2

[*] Systems

- Increased scale of the galaxy based on dolynick's outstanding work with DOF, with some differences and additional balance to achieve a more realistic feel, slow expansion down and make the game a bit more system-centric.

*** The increased scale of gas sprites might impact system performances when playing with lots of stars and / or nebulae. Consider turning galaxy gas off if you experience stuttering.

- Increased scale of stars by a factor of 10.
- Increased scale of planets by a factor of 10.
- Increased scale of planet gravity wells by a factor relative to its planet's size
- Decreased scale of ships by a factor of 0.5.
- Increased default system spacing by a factor of 20.
- Increased variance in planet count per system.
- Home systems now have an additional food planet.
- Home systems now have an additional ore asteroid.
- Home systems now have an additional FTL crystals asteroid.
- Home systems now have an additional anomaly.

[*] Resources

- FTL costs voluntarily unchanged to not disadvantage sublight races even more and force careful management of hyperspace travel.
- Empires no longer start with any FTL generation or FTL storage regardless of FTL trait choice.
- FTL shards asteroids now provide +1 FTL/s and permanently add 250 FTL storage.
- Added FTL crystals asteroid: provides +1 FTL/s and add 250 FTL storage. Does not disappear (but can be captured). As noted above, empires start with one such asteroid in their home system.
- FTL planets now provide +0.5/+1/+1.5/+2.5/+4/+7/+12 FTL/s.
