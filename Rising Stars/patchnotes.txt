v1.2

[*] Artifacts

- Renamed Arcology to Sky City.

[*] Attitudes

- Progressive Level 3 effect now grants four times as less research points to compensate for higher FTL energy amounts spent overall.

[*] Buildings

- Space Elevator has been renamed to Orbital Elevator and now adds 1 money generation per Planet Level starting from Level 1 if a Starport is present in the system and additionally costs 1k ore and 50 labor to build.
- Added Fuel Facility: Adds 1 energy pressure and 1 money pressure and increases the pressure given by native Natural Gas or Oil by 1. Base build and maintenance costs of 110 and 50k, respectively. Also costs 50 research to build.
- Added Electronics Factory: Can replace a Level 1 resource and adds 3 money pressure. Consumes 8 ore per minute. Base build and maintenance costs of 40k and 30k, respectively. The building becomes inactive if there is no more ore left on the planet.
- Added Healthcare Complex: Adds 1 population. Base build and maintenance costs of 85k and 20k, respectively. Also costs 50 research to build and 50 more for each Healthcare Complex already built or building on the planet.
- Added Arcology: Adds 5 population and replaces 5 cities. Costs 2.5M, 2k ore, 20 influence, and 50 labor.

[*] FTL

- Increased hyperdrive speed by a factor of 20 and distance cost by a factor of 1.25. Decreased initial activation cost by a factor of 2.
- Increased fling beacon range by a factor of 2, fling cost by a factor of 2 and maintenance cost to 0.25 FTL/s.
- Increased slipstream optimal range by a factor of 10.
- Increased jump drive range by a factor of 10.
- Increased gate maintenance cost to 0.25 FTL/s.

*** FTL is roughly twice as less efficient compared to vanilla to make long distances matter more, especially in the beginning of a game. Hyperdrive speed ratio is identical to vanilla to make up for its decreased effectiveness over very long distances. Costs are balanced to make FTL a luxury at first, but common later, as more FTL sources and storage become available.

[*] Game Options

- Added Quick Start: when toggled on, empires will be able to expand to other systems almost immediately instead of having to build a basic economy first. This reverts the now slower game start to more or less vanilla speed. This option is off by default.
- Added Supermassive Black Holes: when toggled on, black holes at the center of galaxies are supermassive and thus much bigger. Much. BIGGER. (And make an equally bigger boom.)
- Disable Starting Fleets is now on by default.
- Default asteroid and orbital labor cost step increased to 100% (up from 50%).

[*] Lifestyles

- Extragalactic colonizer speed multiplier changed to 0.5 (down from 2). The bonus speed combined with three starting systems was an extremely unfair advantage under the new balance.

[*] Orbitals

- Commerce Stations now provide 150k income for each friendly planet in the system excluding the owner's, up to 450k. Only one Commerce Station may now be built per system.
- Added Starport. Provides 25k income for each owned and friendly planet in the system, up to 75k. Support ships assigned to a Starport independently move across the system to attack enemy fleets. Can be upgraded to allow global resource trade. Only one Starport may be constructed per system.
- Subspace Telescope Array has been renamed to Quantum Telescope Array, has no maintenance cost anymore and can no longer move. Its Telescope ability now has a range of 1 million units and it now costs an amount of energy and FTL energy linearly relative to the target distance.
- Added Telescope Array, which has 40% size, cost and Telescope power than the quantum version. Requires no ore but has a 40k maintenance cost. Primarily designed for early scouting, when interstellar travel is a problem, and border control. Its Telescope ability only costs enrergy (and no FTL energy).
- Added Staging Hub. Allows trade through its system. Can import and sell resources and store cargo. Planets can be ordered to export their labor to this orbital. Designed to fill various support roles, notably for use as a proximity mining base, as the new balance makes tractoring ore asteroids a pain. Build and maintenance costs of 400k and 125k, respectively.
- Added Zero-G Lab. Gives 1 research generation and allows access to special projects. Build and maintenance costs of 400k and 100k, respectively.
- Added Hyperfield Harvester. Generates 0.15 FTL Energy per second and stores 250 FTL Energy. Build and maintenance costs of 450k and 75k, respectively.
- FTL Storage orbitals for Star Children with Flux FTL now generate 0.5 FTL Energy per second and store 600 FTL Energy to make up for the impossibility to build FTL Breeders. They also additionally cost 500 ore to build.

[*] Planets

- Added gas giants, using unused vanilla low resolution textures. Gas giants can be colonized (more or less) and feature a new scalable resource designed to balance the increased scale of the game by providing increased propulsion speed and various pressure boosts. They are commonly found in all kinds of systems, but they are more difficult to level up due to their mostly useless biome: imperial buildings cannot be built on it and civilian tile development is extremely slow. They however have a large number of moons where bases can be constructed. Gas giants completely bypass resource scarcity and planet frequency options on purpose.
- Fixed a vanilla bug with asteroid fields orbiting Local Asteroid Field Planets not being rendered in certain circumstances.
- Local Asteroid Field planets now have more and bigger asteroids orbiting closer to them (this is a purely cosmetic change).
- Destroyed planets now yield more asteroid with less ore.

[*] Research

- Orbital Command and Orbital Command 2 now also grant 64 and 128 additional support capacity, respectively, to Starports.

[*] Resources

- Added FTL crystals asteroids: provide +1 FTL/s and add 250 FTL storage. These are not consumed when mined (but they can be captured...). Spawn frequency is slightly lower than FTL shards.
- FTL shards asteroids now permanently add 500 FTL storage (up from 100).
- FTL planets now provide 0.5/1/1.5/2/3/5/10 FTL/s.
- Added Rare Gases, a new scalable resource found on gas giants only. Increases all ship engine thrust (including colony ships) by a cumulative bonus of 0%/5%/15%/30%/60%/100%/175%. Does not increase turn rate nor hyperdrive speed. Gains 2 Energy pressure per level starting from level 1, 2 Defense pressure per level starting from level 2, 2 Research pressure per level starting from level 3, 2 Influence pressure per level starting from level 4 and 2 Money pressure per level starting from level 5. Cannot be exported.
*** Sublight species are strongly advised to heavily invest in developing those planets!
- Available ore on asteroids has been reduced to anywhere from 50 to 1250 ore (down from 500 to 10000). Default ore asteroid chance per system has been changed to 90% (up from 45%). In addition, systems with ore asteroids are very likely to have a LOT of them.
- Moderately increased resource asteroid chance. Slightly decreased Construction Materials and Morphic Materials asteroid chance. Moderately decreased FTL Shards asteroid chance.
- Added a 5% chance for systems to have one or more asteroid belts. These have a chance to contain resource asteroids equal to 1/30th of the resource asteroid chance.
- Black holes now have a big, thick asteroid belt beyond their accretion disk.
- Increased default resource asteroid chance to 60% (up from 45%).
- Renamed Electronics resource to Semiconductors.
- Deuterium and Neutronium can now very rarely spawn as an asteroid resource.
- Comets and Protoplanets now have a low chance of spawning in systems regardless of the artifact frequency option.
- Welfare option base threshold is now 200k (down from 350k).
- Empires now have an additional Food planet in their home system, but one less in adjacent systems.
- Empires now have 6k worth of ore asteroids in their home system instead of one 6k ore asteroid.
- Empires now have an additional an additional FTL crystals asteroid in their home system. A mine is prebuilt if the Quick Start game option is toggled on. This effectively reverts the starting FTL generation and FTL storage to vanilla values.
- Empires now have an additional an additional Pekelm asteroid in an adjacent system.
- Empires now have an additional an additional FTL crystals asteroid in a neighboring system.
- Empires now have an additional an additional Explosives asteroid in a neighboring system.
- Empires now have an additional an additional Neutronium asteroid in a neighboring system.
- Empires now have an additional anomaly in their home system.
- Empires now have an additional Comet in their home system.
- Empires now have one less Water planet in adjacent systems.
- Empires no longer start with any FTL generation or FTL storage regardless of FTL trait choice.
- Guaranteed resources on planets in systems adjacent to starting systems can now spawn farther in the neighborhood to counterbalance the addition of nebulae and planetless systems, which can deadlock the distribution.

[*] Subsystems

- Added sensors back to the mod with a completely different approach. All ship and station hulls now have integrated basic sensors. Sight range is low and slightly scaled with size. Specific sensor subsystems can be added to designs to further enhance sight range but their design is now focused on handling high costs rather than competing with armor.
- Added Sensor Dish. Increases sight range by a small amount. Adding more than one dish doesn't increase sight range more and only gives redundancy benefits.
- Added Phasing Sensor. Increases sight range by a moderate amount, decreasing as the subsystem's size increases. High Power cost. Requires increasingly high amounts of Control as the subsystem's size increases. Sinew halves the Control requirements.
- Increased most weapon ranges by a factor of 2. Energy Bomb, Plasma Thrower, Pulse Bolt and Subspace Shredder ranges are unchanged. The Flak Battery range formula has been tweaked to keep a much more linear and slow progression relative to ship size.
- Increased Fleet Computer raiding range bonus (and base raiding range) by a factor of 3.

[*] Systems

- Increased scale of the galaxy based on dolynick's outstanding work with DOF, with some differences and additional balance to achieve a more realistic feel, slow expansion down and make the game a bit more system-centric.
*** The increased scale of gas sprites strongly impacts system performances when playing with lots of stars and / or nebulae. Consider turning galaxy gas off if you experience stuttering.
- Increased scale of stars by a factor of 10.
- Increased scale of planets by a factor of 10.
- Increased scale of planet gravity wells by a factor relative to its planet's 'mass'.
- Increased scale of ringworld gravity wells to their system's radius to simulate them having no gravity well (they have no core), but instead objects actually orbiting around the star. As a side effect, orbitals restricted to planet gravity well can be built anywhere in the system, which seems completely reasonable for ringworlds.
- Increased scale of asteroids by a factor of 2.
- Decreased scale of ships by a factor of 0.5.
- Increased default system spacing by a factor of 20.
- Increased variance in vertical spacing of systems in the core of spiral galaxies.
- Increased variance in planet number per system. Planetless systems have greatly increased chance of hiding valuable asteroids and artifacts.
- Black holes in the core of spiral and cluster galaxies are now supermassive if the Supermassive Black Holes game option is toggled on.
*** The massive scale of the supermassive black holes accretion disks slightly impacts system performances. Consider turning this option off if you experience stuttering.
- The guaranteed moon around the level 1 planet in the home system has moved to the homeworld.

[*] User Interface

- Reduced Ore Asteroid strategic icons by a factor of 3 so their sheer number does not disturb strategic icon system display when zoomed out.

[*] Known issues

- Regular planets will sometimes have a gas giant atmosphere. This is most probably due to how the game distribute resources during map creation.
