v1.1.2

[*] Artificial Intelligence

- Most AIs are now able to build outposts and expand beyond systems without planets. Some specific AIs (Star Children, Evangelists) cannot yet.

[*] Buildings

- Added Mining Complex, available to non-Ancient races. Adds an Ore resource that can be exported and generates 10 ore per minute at its destination. Also adds 2 labor pressure and
increases the pressure given by native Aluminium, Iron, Titanium or Supercarbons by 2. Unlike the Ancient Strip Miner, ore stored on the planet is not moved on export. High build and maintenance costs.

[*] Game Options

- Added Automatically Claim Spatial Anomalies: When toggled on, spatial anomalies in your tradable area will automatically be claimed into your territory. Toggled on by default.
*** This adds the possibility to deactivate the script created by Dalo Lorn, which might not suit everyone and is still buggy. AI expansion will not be hindered as they can now build outposts.

[*] Subsystems

- Removed the 90% maintenance cost reduction for Miner Hull. Extensive mining infrastructures should have a cost and in addition it made possible to maintain any unarmed unsupported flagship (like scouts or slipstream ships) basically for free.
- Re-added Muon Cannon and rebalanced it accordingly. Now Renamed to Muon Projector.
- Muon Cannon Battery renamed to Muon Projector Battery.
- Re-added Carpet Bomb with supply cost doubled.
- Railgun Battery is now enhanced in the same way as support Railgun when Muon Projectors are researched (bonus to damage, accuracy and armor penetration).
