v1.1.2

[*] Balance

- Removed the 90% maintenance cost reduction for Miner Hull. Extensive mining infrastructures should have a cost and in addition it made possible to maintain any unarmed unsupported flagship (like scouts or slipstream ships) basically for free.

[*] Buildings

- Added Mining Complex, available to non-Ancient races. Adds 6 ore per minute generation to the planet and 2 labor pressure.

[*] Subsystems

- Added support Muon Cannon back to the mod and rebalanced it accordingly. Now Renamed to Muon Projector.
- Muon Cannon Battery renamed to Muon Projector Battery.
- Added Carpet Bomb back to the mod with supply cost doubled.
- Railgun Battery is now enhanced in the same way as support Railgun when Muon Projectors are researched (bonus to damage, accuracy and armor penetration).
