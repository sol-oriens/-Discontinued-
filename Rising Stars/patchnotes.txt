v1.2

[*] Game Options

- Added Quick Start: when toggled on, empires will be able to expand to other systems almost immediately instead of having to build a basic economy first. This reverts the now slower game start to more or less vanilla speed. This option is off by default.
- Disable Starting Fleets is now on by default.
- Added Supermassive Black Holes: when toggled on, black holes at the center of galaxies are supermassive and thus much bigger. Much. BIGGER. (And make an equally bigger boom.)

[*] Orbitals
- Subspace Telescope Array has been renamed to Quantum Telescope Array, has no maintenance cost anymore and can no longer move. Its Telescope ability now has a range of 1 million units and it now costs an amount of energy linearly relative to the target distance.
- Added Telescope Array, which has 40% size, cost and Telescope power than the quantum version. Requires no ore but has a 40k maintenance cost. Primarily designed for early scouting, when interstellar travel is a problem, and border control.

[*] Resources

- FTL costs voluntarily unchanged to not disadvantage sublight races even more and force careful management of hyperspace travel.
- Empires no longer start with any FTL generation or FTL storage regardless of FTL trait choice.
- Added FTL crystals asteroids: provide +1 FTL/s and add 250 FTL storage. These are not consumed when mined (but they can be captured...). As noted below, empires start with one such asteroid in their home system.
- FTL shards asteroids now provide +1 FTL/s and permanently add 250 FTL storage.
- FTL planets now provide +0.5/+1/+1.5/+2.5/+4/+7/+12 FTL/s.

[*] Systems

- Increased scale of the galaxy based on dolynick's outstanding work with DOF, with some differences and additional balance to achieve a more realistic feel, slow expansion down and make the game a bit more system-centric.
*** The increased scale of gas sprites strongly impacts system performances when playing with lots of stars and / or nebulae. Consider turning galaxy gas off if you experience stuttering.
- Increased scale of stars by a factor of 10.
- Increased scale of planets by a factor of 10.
- Increased scale of planet gravity wells by a factor relative to its planet's mass.
- Decreased scale of ships by a factor of 0.5.
- Increased default system spacing by a factor of 20.
- Increased variation in vertical spacing of systems in the core of spiral galaxies.
- Increased variation in planet number per system.
- Black holes in the core of spiral and cluster galaxies are now supermassive if the Supermassive Black Holes game option is toggled on.
*** The massive scale of the supermassive black holes accretion disks slightly impacts system performances. Consider turning this option off if you experience stuttering.
- Empires now have an additional food planet in their home system.
- Empires now have an additional an additional ore asteroid in their home system.
- Empires now have an additional an additional FTL crystals asteroid in their home system. A mine is prebuilt if the Quick Start game option is toggled on. This effectively reverts the starting FTL generation and FTL storage to vanilla values.
- Empires now have an additional anomaly in their home system.
