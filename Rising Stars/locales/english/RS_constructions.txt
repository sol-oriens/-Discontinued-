CONS_MOON_BASE_DESC: <<
	Construct a large amount of infrastructure on one of the planet's moons, making more area available for placing buildings and increasing the maximum population of the planet by 2.

	Only one moon base may be constructed for every moon present in orbit of the planet.

	Mechanoid races receive §100k additional income from each moon base they own.
>>
C_TERRAFORMING_DESC: <<
	[color=#aaa][i]Modifying the climate or constructing the required support infrastructure to easily sustain large amounts of people or equipment within a certain area is usually a slow venture.

	An industrial-scale project sponsored by the empire can accelerate the process considerably, for a price.[/i][/color]

	Develops up to 15 randomly selected tiles.
>>
C_HABITATRING_DESC: <<
	[color=#aaa][i]Constructing a large ring-shaped station encircling the planet provides more space for the construction of important infrastructure.[/i][/color]

	Adds a 4x8 chunk of fully-developed Artificial tiles to the planet. Can only be built once per planet.

C_HABITATRING: Orbital Habitation Ring
C_TERRAFORMING: Infrastructural Development
C_SUBSURFACE_HABITATS: Subsurface Habitation Complex
C_SUBSURFACE_NO_FLOATING_CONTINENT: [i]Subsurface habitats cannot be built while a Floating Continent is present on the planet surface. Move the Floating Continent to a different planet before attempting to construct them.[/i]
C_SUBSURFACE_HABITATS_DESC: <<
	[color=#aaa][i]Constructing an underground complex kilometers underneath the planet's surface provides more space for the construction of important infrastructure.[/i][/color]

	Adds a 10x2 chunk of undeveloped Artificial tiles to the planet. Can only be built once per planet. Unlocks the 'Expand Subsurface Complex' construction.

	[bbloc=#C_SUBSURFACE_NO_FLOATING_CONTINENT/]
>>
C_EXPAND_SUBSURFACE: Expand Subsurface Complex
C_EXPAND_SUBSURFACE_DESC: <<
	[color=#aaa][i]Expanding our subsurface habitats grants us even more space for the construction of important infrastructure.[/i][/color]

	Adds a 10x1 chunk of undeveloped Artificial tiles to the planet, attached to the Subsurface Habitation Complex. Subsequent subsurface habitat expansions will require increasingly large amounts of Ore and Labor to construct.

C_FLING_UNLOCK: Refined Beacon Architecture
C_FLING_UNLOCK_DESC: <<
	Use the data collected during the construction and use of this fling beacon to improve your beacon designs, allowing for smaller, cheaper fling beacons to be constructed.

	Unlocks the Fling Beacon orbital.

	[i][bbloc=#ORB_FLING_CORE_DESC/][/i]
>>
C_GATE_UNLOCK: Streamlined Wormhole Equations
C_GATE_UNLOCK_DESC: <<
	Use the data collected during the construction and use of this stargate to improve your gate designs, allowing for the easy construction of more customizable gates.

	Unlocks the Gate subsystem for use on stations.

OUTPOST_ARMORING: Structural Enhancement
OUTPOST_ARMORING_DESC: <<
	Reinforce the orbital's frame and outer hull, allowing it to withstand more damage before critical failure.

	Adds 10000 health and 5000 armor. May be modified by upgrades that improve orbital health. Subsequent structural enhancement requires increasingly large amounts of Ore to perform.
>>
OUTPOST_DEFENSE: Refit Launch Bays
OUTPOST_DEFENSE_DESC: <<
	Perform a substantial retrofit of the orbital's hangar deck and docking ports, allowing it to support more vessels coming in or out at any given time. The additional traffic also encourages the civilian sector to assist with constructing additional defense ships.

	Adds 256 support capacity and 4 Defense generation. Subsequent hangar refits require increasingly large amounts of Ore to perform.
>>
OUTPOST_WEAPONS: Install Swarm Missiles
OUTPOST_WEAPONS_DESC: <<
	Install a swarm missile launcher on the orbital's exterior, improving its ability to hold off raiders or interrupt enemy trade.

	Adds 10 missile tubes, each firing one missile per second for a damage of 50 per missile. May be modified by upgrades that improve stationary defense weapons. Subsequent missile launchers require increasingly large amounts of Ore to install.
>>

RESEARCH_LAB_HYPERCORE: Hypercore
RESEARCH_LAB_HYPERCORE_DESC: <<
	Fueling a nuclear fusion reactor with hyperfield particles produces a highly unstable form of energy stored in what is colloquially known as a hypercore.
>>

RESEARCH_LAB_CRYSTALLIZER: Hyperfield Crystallizer
RESEARCH_LAB_CRYSTALLIZER_DESC: <<
This highly advanced device is able to artificially reproduce the FTL crystal formation process at an accelerated rate through a complex chain reaction.

	Unlocks the Synthetic FTL Crystals Project.
>>

RESEARCH_LAB_FTL: FTL Crystals
RESEARCH_LAB_FTL_DESC: <<
	A method of creating limited quantities of FTL crystals at a high energy cost. Unfortunately, quantic instabilities make the process highly inaccurate and not likely to ever be industrialized.

	Generates up to 200 FTL energy.
